# Code of Conduct for TWC London

Below is a summary of TWC London's Code of Conduct (points 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,
and 17). The full Code of Conduct is
[here](/assets/files/london-code-of-conduct.pdf).

### 1. London Tech Workers Coalition Mission Statement

We are a coalition of workers, labour organisers, community organisers, and
friends in and around the tech industry. We organise for activism, civic
engagement, direct action, and education around the world. We work in
solidarity with existing movements towards social justice, workers' rights, and
economic inclusion. We exist to organise, educate, and build solidarity between
tech workers, labour organisers and activists in order to improve the
conditions of all workers. Our vision is to utilise tech worker power, to raise
class consciousness for the end of tech-enabled oppression and exploitation of
all workers.

### 2. What is this document for?

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour. This
Code of Conduct and its related procedures also extend to unacceptable
behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities when such
behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of
community members.

### 3. Who is this for?

The Code of Conduct applies to:

- Members of the London TWC.
- Partners and collaborators.
- Guests.

### 4. Where does this apply?

The following is not an exhaustive list of where the Code of Conduct applies,
but intended for guidance:

- Meetings (virtual or in-person).
- Slack discussion channels.
- Social media (e.g. posts, comments).
- TWC events.
- One-on-one interactions between TWC members / partners & collaborators /
  guests, or interactions pertaining to community business.

It’s expected that members of TWC behave in ways that uphold our values inside
and outside contexts associated with TWC.

### 6. Forbidden Behaviour

As a coalition of workers coming from many backgrounds, TWC is focussed on
providing a space, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or
lack thereof, etc. 

We do not tolerate harassment in any form by members, partners, collaborators,
or guests, including:

- Violence or threats of violence.
- Language which is racist, sexist/misogynist, homophobic, transphobic,
  ableist, fatphobic, derogatory against protected characterics, etc.
- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, age, religion, etc.
- Sexual language or imagery.
- Intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Unwelcome photography or recording.
- Sustained disruption of meetings, discussions, or other events.
- Inappropriate physical contact.
- Invasion of personal space.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

As an activist organisation, TWC advocates for the disenfranchised and will
privilege their needs. Accountability reps first priority is to protect those
at more risk of being materially disadvantaged, e.g. systematically
marginalised, losing their jobs for their activism, etc. 

### 7. How is this Code of Conduct enforced?

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. We operate by a 2 strike policy and these are on the basis of
instances of behaviour. 

- 2 strike (1 incident with warning. If done again, you’re out)
  - In effect for? *Year-long exclusion (removed from meetings, banned from
    future events, removed from Slack, blocked on Twitter, etc.); return on
    condition of agreement amongst accountability reps; after returning, the
    perpetrator will be subject to a single strike policy. This incident will be
    reported to the global TWC organisers*.

- Outside of TWC associated spaces
  - Please do raise issues to the accountability reps about issues relating to
    past behaviours outside of TWC contexts. People who have demonstrated prior
    behaviour that would have contravened our Code of Conduct will be given 1
    strike.
