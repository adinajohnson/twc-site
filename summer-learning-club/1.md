# Tech Workers Inquiry
**Saturday, July 15, 2017, 4PM-6PM**

### Description

An experimental strategic reflection/discussion about tech worker organizing, via a reflection on our own positions and experiences in tech: where we work, what kind of work we do, what we produce, where we are positioned in supply chains, who our coworkers are, what kind of unrest and grievances we observe around us, and so on.  Through such a reflection, we can map out both the “terrain of struggle” of the tech industry, where we are located in this terrain, and how this should inform our organizing strategy.  We can also begin to understand how information about companies and the market is present, or hidden -- in other words, understanding what we don’t know about our workplaces is just as important as listing out what we do know.       

This is largely inspired by the idea of "Workers’ Inquiry", which is the very simple and straightforward idea that labor organizing strategy has to be rooted into actual research, investigation, and communication between workers.      

This initial small session will mostly be an experiment, that can hopefully be developed into something that can be brought to the TWC, tech workers, and workers in general, which can facilitate strategic reflections and discussions, and the development of class consciousness among tech workers.
